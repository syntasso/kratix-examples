# Terraform AWS Buckets Promise

This Promise is an example that shows how to drive the creation of Terraform
resources using Kratix. For this particular use case, we focus on creating S3
buckets in AWS, targetting different workspaces depending on the Team requesting the bucket.

This example promise is used in [this guide](https://docs.kratix.io/ske/guides/scheduling-terraform-workspaces).
