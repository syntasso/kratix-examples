# Kratix Terraform Promise Example

This directory demonstrates how to expose Terraform modules as self-service APIs using Kratix, and how to manage infrastructure as a fleet.

## What's Inside

- [**01-terraform-promise.md**](./01-terraform-promise.md):  
  Bootstrap a Kratix Promise from a Terraform module (e.g. EC2)

- [**02-fleet-management.md**](./02-fleet-management.md):  
  Apply centralized changes to all resources by updating the Promise. No PRs, no manual coordination, just fleet-wide governance.

## Highlights

✔️ Build Promises from Terraform modules  
✔️ Expose infrastructure via Kubernetes APIs  
✔️ Automate `apply` and `destroy` workflows  
✔️ Scale updates across all requests with one change

Start with [01-terraform-promise.md](./01-terraform-promise.md).
